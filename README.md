# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection Using FCM Segmentation, EfficientNetB4 and XGBoost

This repository contains the implementation of our **IEEE-published research** on automated **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** detection from microscopic blood smear images.

The proposed hybrid framework combines **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) Segmentation**, **EfficientNetB4 Deep Feature Extraction**, and **GPU-Accelerated XGBoost Classification** to accurately distinguish **Benign** and **Malignant** blood smear samples.
